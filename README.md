# Oyster
This is an old project, moved to GitHub for visibility for everyone.

The goal was to automate the construction of a UI dashboard in Bokeh by specifying the UI interface in JSON. 

## How it worked
The user specified the interface properties (widgets etc.) in a JSON file. The code built a model-view-controller like structure from the JSON.

It worked well, but needed a lot of attention.

## Current status
I have no intention of maintaining the project, it's parked.

Projects like Django were always a much better bet for this type of work, so I've let this project go.
